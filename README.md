This is the repo for the backend portion of Diggable, a crowd-funding platform specifically targeted at Independent musicians. Diggable aims to help alleviate the financial stress of touring by allowing artists to set a financial goal and offer unique rewards to their fans to help them reach that goal.

This is the server side/backend repo only, and should be ran in conjunction with the frontend repo which can be found at https://github.com/willhoare/diggable-frontend

Once all depdendencies have been installed, run 'node index.js' or 'node --watch index.js' in the terminal in order to start the server. 
 
 Then run npm start on the front end to launch the application.
